# IEEE UCSD Website

## Before we get started

**Font**

We use Open Sans as our font. You can read more about why we use it [here](https://brand-experience.ieee.org/whats-your-type/):

**JS Framework**

We use AstroJS in order to easily create blog posts and incorperate components from different frameworks, such as React and Vite.

## Getting started

To get start, clone our repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ieeeucsd/ieeeucsd.org
```

and install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Contributing

If you are not a part of IEEE but still want to contribute to the project, make sure you clone the repository and make a pull request. We will look over your code and if everything looks good, we will merge it with the main branch.
